## About

I build production systems that handle real users, real data, and real scale. I architected a multi-tenant, location-based community rewards platform (YourOpoly) from the ground up — Flutter + Node.js, MySQL, and AWS ECS.

I mentored **100+** students at Bellevue University across full-stack development, databases, and system design. Currently pursuing an **M.S. in Data Science**, bridging engineering with machine learning and data-driven systems.

## This repository

Astro + React single-page portfolio (dark emerald theme, motion accents).

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

Deploy (both remotes, same `main`):

- **GitHub Pages** — [`.github/workflows/astro.yml`](.github/workflows/astro.yml) builds with Node 22 and deploys `dist/` (custom domain: **robert-stewart.dev**)
- **GitLab Pages** — [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) builds with Node 22 and publishes the Pages artifact

Push to either remote to update that host:

```bash
git push origin main   # GitHub Pages
git push gitlab main   # GitLab Pages
```
